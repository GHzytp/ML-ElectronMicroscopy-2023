Dear colleagues 

Thank you for your interest in the Summer School on Machine Learning in Electron Microscopy. My colleagues and I believe that machine learning can change the way microscopy operates on all levels – from analysis of imaging and hyperspectral data to microscope optimization to the way instruments scan, acquire spectra, and even design and execute experiments. We welcome you to join this vision. 
The purpose of this school is to provide an introduction and hands-on skills that constitute the individual elements of this transition and take it to the next level as a community. To follow the first e-mail containing the initial parameters for the course, several additional items:

First, science and technology is always first about the people who make it happen. I would like to introduce the organizing team:
•	Maxim Ziatdinov, the creator of AtomAI and GPax – https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YnSdOoUAAAAJ&hl=en
•	Gerd Duscher, one of the pioneers of open science for electron microscopy - https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=kAI2T5EAAAAJ
•	Rama Vasudevan, the creator and maintainer of PyCroscopy - https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b2XP9A4AAAAJ&hl=en

And the team of our colleagues who present at depth discussions on specific areas of STEM ML, including:
•	Ayana Ghosh - https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=g19PCkIAAAAJ
•	Kevin Roccapriore - https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=PJwlbBIAAAAJ
